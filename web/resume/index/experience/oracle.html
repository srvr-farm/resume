        <b>Remote Execution</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed and built a custom Socat like application in go used as a connection relay for remote command execution. The relay
            was used to plum the front end connection from the customer facing remote execution endpoints into the containers running 
            in the customers container instances on the hypervisor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Helped setup the data plane API that handled incoming remote execution requests from customers, and routed them to the customer's
            containers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Built the implementation on the container instance agent for sending the remote execution requests to containerd, and launching
            the connection relays for plumbing the connection from the hypervisor to the container instance and from the container instance
            to the container.

          <li>
            Helped launch the Container Instances (Container Virtual Machine) service for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
            Container instances are used as the back end for serverless kubernetes, and also as a publicly available customer facing service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and built the Hypervisor Imaging and Testing pipeline. A completely automated process of taking a 
            vanilla Linux OS image, configure it, install the dataplane services, export it to a bootable image, test it using 
            nested virtualization, create an updater application for updating existing hypervisors, and deploy it to our staging environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and built a system for monitoring availability of all customer instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created the data plane availability monitoring dashboards and customer experience metrics reporting tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and built the automated pipeline for testing hypervisor images in a Beta testing environment, rolling changes out to our
            integration testing environment, and carefully releasing to production in stages, with automated validation of each stage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created the Data Plane canary tests for monitoring production data plane health, as well as release pipeline stage validation.

            Lead a team of engineers in building a service that takes a Vanilla Linux OS image and a package manifest, and builds a bootable
            Linux image that can be used to launch a Hypervisor. Hypervisor images are used to host all Virtual Machine images as well as 
            Container Virtual Machine instances.
