        <b>Remote Execution</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed and built a custom Socat like connection relay written in go. Used as a connection relay for remote command execution. 
            The relay was used to plum the front end connection from the customer facing remote execution endpoints into the containers running 
            in the customers container instances on the hypervisor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Helped setup the data plane API that handled incoming remote execution requests from customers, and routed them to the customer's
            containers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Built the implementation on the container instance agent for sending the remote execution requests to containerd, and launching
            the connection relays for plumbing the connection from the hypervisor to the container instance and from the container instance
            to the container.
          </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Container Instance Service</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Helped launch the Container Instances (Container Virtual Machine) service for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
            Container instances are used as the back end for serverless kubernetes, and also as a publicly available customer facing service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and built the Hypervisor Imaging and Testing pipeline. A completely automated process of taking a 
            vanilla Linux OS image, configure it, install the dataplane services, export it to a bootable image, test it using 
            nested virtualization, create an updater application for updating existing hypervisors, and deploy it to our staging environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and built a system for monitoring availability of all customer instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created the data plane availability monitoring dashboards and customer experience metrics reporting tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and built the automated pipeline for testing hypervisor images in a Beta testing environment, rolling changes out to our
            integration testing environment, and carefully releasing to production in stages, with automated validation of each stage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created the Data Plane canary tests for monitoring production data plane health, as well as release pipeline stage validation.

        <b>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Hypervisor Imaging</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed and built the Hypervisor Imaging system for building and testing hypervisor images for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</li>
          <li>
            Lead a team of engineers in building a service that takes a Vanilla Linux OS image and a package manifest, and builds a bootable
            Linux image that can be used to launch a Hypervisor. Hypervisor images are used to host all Virtual Machine images as well as 
            Container Virtual Machine instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and built the imaging host fleet monitoring systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and built the application for updating all existing hypervisors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and built a fully automated testing pipeline for hypervisor images. The pipeline builds and tests the image in a virtualized environment, using paravirtualization and a mocked overlay,
            and then moves to testing on bare metal, and finishes with staging a deployment of the release candidate image to our staging environment. Tests include baseline performance tests, feature tests, and 
            some chaos testing.

        <b>Virtual Machine Diagnostics</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed, built and maintained a tool for providing self service virtual machine diagnostics for internal users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and implemented data plane level telemetry collection processes for providing continuous monitoring of all Virtual Machines.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and implemented a system for propogating additional information from the control plane to the dataplane to streamline the correlation of
            data plane telemetry data to specific customer VM instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added a front end for the diagnostics tool in the internal devops site to allow for self service VM diagnostics. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed the tool to be usable by individual engineers to perform custom diagnostics. This also aided in the development of the diganostics tool itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and led the development of a deep diagnostics tool for collecting detailed host and instance diagnostic logs and data. The tool was used
            to collect the data as a bundle, and automatically send it to the Oracle Linux team to perform in depth analysis. The tool helped reduce the time
            to engage kernel developers on the Oracle Linux team when debugging complex system level issues.
