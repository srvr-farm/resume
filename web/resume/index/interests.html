        <b>Music</b>
        <p>
          I love music. I play saxophone, guitar, bass, piano and drums, and I like to record in my free time.
          I'm always looking for anyone interested in having a jam session.

        <b>Home Lab</b>
        <p>
          I'm always tinkering with my home lab. I currently have 3 physical servers with a total of 30 cores. I use the resources
          for my personal development work, playing around with different hardware, experimenting with various technologies, operating
          systems, tools, and pretty much anything else you might want to do with a computer. Most recently I've been experimenting with
          a basic pipeline for generating preconfigured, immutable OS images for VMs running various services at home.
