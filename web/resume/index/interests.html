        <b>Music</b>
        <p>
          I love music. I play saxophone, guitar, bass, piano and drums, and I like to record in my free time.
          I'm always looking for anyone interested in having a jam session, and I recently setup a home recording studio.

        <b>Home Lab</b>
        <p>
          I'm always tinkering with my home lab. I currently have several physical servers running minecraft servers for my kids, 
          the TP link Omada controller service and several other services behind a reverse proxy. I've also built an AI server with 48GB of VRAM. 
          I use the resources for my personal development work, playing around with different hardware, experimenting with various technologies, 
          operating systems, tools, and pretty much anything else you might want to do with a computer.
